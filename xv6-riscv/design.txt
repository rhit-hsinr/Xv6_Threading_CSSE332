High level description
======================

We have added two kernel system calls and two user functions. The two kernel system calls are called clone and join while the two user functions are called uspork_create and uspork_join.

1. The clone function is used for process creation and essentially imitating a lightweight thread being implemented.
2. The join function is to safely join the thread in the future to avoid memory leaks etc.

The user function allows the user to do a system call through the user function by creating a wrapper around the system calls.

Thread creation
================



Stack separation
================

Describe how your threads gets assigned different stacks (even though they are
still in separate address spaces for now).

Test cases
===========

- Describe the test case you used for the creation of the threads.
